# Staged-Combustion-Project-
This repository will document my contributions to OSU Liquid Rocket Systems' next-generation staged combustion engine

I joined the staged combustion project in August of 2025 with nearly zero experience in Liquid propulsion systems design. 
This documents my journey to becoming an excellent propulsion engineer.


The first thing I did to officially join the team was to complete a CFD challenge, where I was meant to simulate a bell nozzle of a previous engine. 
I completed this sim as a means to learn about ANSYS Fluent and how bell nozzles work.
